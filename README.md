## Projects Overview
### List Formatter
A utility that formats a list of items with proper grammar, adding commas and the word "and" appropriately.

### Backpack Inventory Manager
A simple inventory system that allows users to add items to a virtual backpack and check if specific items are present.

### Password Manager
A secure password management system that:
- Encrypts passwords using a Caesar cipher
- Stores encrypted passwords in a CSV file
- Allows lookup of stored passwords
- Includes unit tests to verify encryption functionality


## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic Python syntax and data structures
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)
- File I/O operations
- CSV data handling
- Basic encryption techniques
- Unit testing
- Input validation and error handling
- User interface design for command-line applications


## Getting Started
Each project folder contains its own README with instructions on how to run and use the program.
